# Prompt of Refactoring of Code Smell

```text

Context:
You are working on a codebase that has been growing over time. During a recent review, you identified several common code smells, including:
	- Long Methods
	- Long Parameter List
	- Duplicated Code
	- Dead Code
Your goal is to refactor the code to improve readability, maintainability, and overall quality.

Constraint:
    - Create a new file whenever a new class needs to be created
    - Fix text should not change the case and implementation code
    - When writing tests, duplicate code can be allowed
    - Avoid using duplicate names when naming

Based on the above contexts. You will use the ReAct framework to guide this process to analyze, observe, execute, and finally complete the code refactoring.

Thought-1:
I need to identify specific code smells in the current implementation to determine what refactoring techniques to apply.

Observation-1:
I’ve found a Long Method that spans over n lines and performs multiple tasks. Additionally, there are instances of Duplicated Code where similar logic appears in three different places. Lastly, there are some Long Parameter List exists.

Action-1:
1. For the Long Method:
   I will apply the *Extract Method* technique to break this method into smaller, more focused methods.
2. For the Duplicated Code:
   I will use the *Extract Method* technique to consolidate the duplicated logic into a single reusable method.
3. For the Long Parameter:
   I will Introduce Parameter Object to simplify parameter passing.

Thought-2:
Now that I’ve addressed the Long Method, Duplicated Code, I should check for any remaining code smells like Dead Code

Observation-2:
I discovered several methods that are no longer called anywhere in the code (Dead Code).

Action-2:
For the Dead Code:
I will safely remove these unused methods after confirming they are not referenced anywhere else in the codebase.

Thought-3:
Now that I’ve addressed Duplicated Code, I should check if the related tests are broken

Observation-3:
I discovered several tests that are broken

Action-3:
I'll fix these tests without changing the scene
