Please help me create an SQL database proxy system based on LangChain, which should include the following features:

1. **Database Initialization Module (db_init.py)**:
  - Use SQLite as the database.
  - Be able to import data from a CSV file into the database.
  - Use SQLAlchemy and Pandas for data import processing.
  - The database file should be saved in the `./db/` directory.

2. **SQL Proxy Module (sql_db_agent.py)**:
  - Use LangChain's SQL Agent toolkit.
  - Define `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, load environment variables from the `.env` file using `load_dotenv`.
  - Integrate Google Gemini API as the LLM model, using `gemini-1.5-pro-latest`.
  - Include the following functionalities:
    * Create SQL proxy.
    * Pass parameters as `llm`, `toolkit`, `top_k=30`, `verbose=True`.

3. **Summary of Dependencies**:
  - Create a `requirements.txt` file.
  - List all used dependencies in `requirements.txt`.
  - Include `pandas==2.2.2`, `SQLAlchemy==2.0.30`, other dependencies can be listed without specifying versions.
  - Ensure to include `langchain-google-genai` and `langchain-community` dependencies.

4. **Specific Requirements**:
  - The SQL proxy needs to be able to:
    * Query only relevant columns.
    * Provide query explanations.
  - Response format requirements:
    * Include results.
    * Include SQL queries.

Please generate the complete code implementation based on the above requirements. Write it in a procedural programming style without encapsulating methods.
